My research interests lie in plant breeding, host pathogen interactions, genomics, and the integration of machine learning in crop improvement. I am conducting research on fungicide evaluations, early pathogen detection, metagenomics, and decision support system tools. My work focuses on using bioinformatics and statistical analysis to develop decision-support tools for effective agricultural disease management.\n🔍 Explore: - 📂 My Research - ✍️ My Blog - 📧 Contact Me\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
