Hello! I'm Kamal Chhetri, a PhD student in Plant Pathology at Virginia Tech University. My journey in the field of science began with a Master's degree in Biotechnology from West Virginia State University.

Originally from Nepal, I've always been fascinated by the intricate workings of plant life and the ecosystem. This fascination led me to pursue a career in Plant Pathology, where I'm currently delving into the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

Through this blog, I aim to share machine learning and its application to the agriculture field. Enjoy my blog
