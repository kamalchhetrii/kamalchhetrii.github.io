# Fungicide Efficacy

Foliar fungicides are a key tool for managing corn diseases like tar spot (*Phyllachora maydis*) and gray leaf spot (*Cercospora zeae‑maydis*). Their effectiveness, however, depends on the active ingredients, timing of application, hybrid susceptibility, and disease pressure.

My research in fungicide efficacy focuses on the following areas:

-   **Evaluation of fungicides against Curvularia leaf spot, gray leaf spot, and tar spot disease**: Conducted replicated field trials across Virginia to compare SDHI, QoI, and mixed‑mode products under natural infection.\
    Conducted field trial

-   **Hybrid succeptibility evaluations:** Tested six corn hybrids in 2023 and two hybrids in 2024 at Shenandoah County and Montgomery County, assessing disease severity from VT/R1 through R6.

My approach combines field trials with controlled laboratory assays to provide robust, actionable insights. These results feed into a web‑based decision‑support tool for growers and agronomists, helping to optimize application timing, product choice, and economic return.

I’m actively developing this section—stay tuned for updates!
