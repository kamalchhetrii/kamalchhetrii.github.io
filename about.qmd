[**About me:**]{.underline}

Hi there !

🌱 **Research Interests:**\

I am a second-year PhD student in the **Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science (PPWS) Department** at \[Your University\]. My research focuses on:\

🔬 Evaluating **fungicide efficacies** for corn disease management\

🦠 Studying **corn leaf endophytes** and their microbial community responses to foliar fungicides\

🌾 Unveiling **airborne fungal pathogen communities** in corn fields\

📊 Building **fungicide application decision-support tools** to improve **Tar Spot disease** management

🧬 I work extensively with **metagenomic sequencing**, **bioinformatics pipelines**, and **statistical designs** to analyze microbial communities and their interactions with fungicides.

### 🛠 Skills & Tools:

💻 **Bioinformatics:** Kaiju, KBase, MinION (Nanopore) sequencing, SLURM HPC\

📊 **Statistical Analysis:** R, Python, Experimental Designs (Full Factorial, Fractional Factorial, Incomplete Blocks)\

🌍 **Genomic Analysis:** Taxonomic profiling ( I am learning it), Metagenomics (without assembly), Reference Genome Alignment

### 🏆 Conferences & Presentations:

**Oral Presentation**: American Society for Horticultural Science (ASHS)

**Poster Presentation**: Plant and Animal Genome Conference (PAG)

**Poster Presentation**: American Phytopathological Society (APS)
