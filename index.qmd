# About Me

👨‍🔬 **Kamal Chhetri**

Welcome to my GitHub site !

I am originally from Nepal and I have completed my MS in Biotechnology (Plant breeding). My research interests lie in **plant breeding, host pathogen interactions, genomics, and the integration of machine learning** in crop improvement. I am conducting research on fungicide evaluations, early pathogen detection, metagenomics, and decision support system tools. My work focuses on using **bioinformatics** and **statistical analysis** to develop decision-support tools for effective agricultural disease management.
