# Fungicide Efficacy

Understanding how fungicides work—and their limitations—is key to effective plant disease management. My research in fungicide efficacy focuses on the following areas:

- **Formulation and Dosage:**  
  Evaluating various fungicide formulations and determining optimal dosages to suppress corn pathogens while minimizing environmental impacts.

- **Timing and Application Strategies:**  
  Studying the best timing for application and comparing different delivery methods (e.g., foliar sprays versus soil treatments) to maximize disease control.

- **Resistance Monitoring:**  
  Investigating the development of fungicide resistance in fungal populations. This includes tracking changes in sensitivity and identifying genetic markers associated with resistance.

- **Impact on Crop Health:**  
  Assessing how fungicide treatments affect overall plant health and yield. This research also looks at secondary effects on beneficial microorganisms in the crop ecosystem.

My approach combines field trials with controlled laboratory experiments to provide robust, actionable insights. These results help in the development of decision-support tools for growers and agronomists, contributing to more sustainable and effective disease management practices.
