Hi there !

[**About me:**]{.underline}

I am Kamal Chhetri and I am from Nepal. I completed my master of science at West Virginia State University and am doing my PhD in plant pathology at Virginia Tech University. I am interested in host-pathogen interaction, plant breeding, genomics, modeling, and the application of machine learning in these areas.

[**My project:**]{.underline}

I did my MS in Biotechnology (Plant Breeding) and am now doing my PhD at Virginia Tech University. I am working on corn hybrid susceptibility, the airborne fungal pathogen community, corn leaf endophytes, and fungicide decision-support system tools. I am learning and trying to use machine learning skills for prediction and early decision-making in fungicide decision-support system tools to benefit farmers and make easy decisions about dealing with pathogens.

I aim to share machine learning and its application to the agriculture field. I am also in the learning phase, so your suggestions and feedback will help if you want to reach out to me.
