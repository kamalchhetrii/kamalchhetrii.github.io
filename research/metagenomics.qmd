My research investigates the microbial communities associated with corn plants from airsample using metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Key focus areas include:

- Utilizing HTS based metagenomic sequencing methods to identify the corn foliar fungal, rot rot, and emerging pathogens of corn.
- Analyzing sequencing data using Minimap2 and other bioinformatics tool with bioinformatics pipelines.
