introduction: |
  I’m a second-year PhD student in the Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science Department at Virginia Tech.
  My work bridges field experimentation and high-throughput sequencing to deliver actionable insights for corn disease management.

**🌱Research_interests:**
  - Evaluating fungicide efficacies to optimize integrated disease management for corn
  - Profiling corn leaf endophyte communities and tracking their response to foliar treatments
  - Characterizing airborne fungal pathogens in commercial corn fields
  - Developing decision-support tools for Tar Spot disease forecasting and management
  - Implementing metagenomic sequencing and custom bioinformatics pipelines for microbial community analysis

**Skills_tools:**
  bioinformatics:
    - Kaiju for taxonomic classification
    - KBase workflows with SLURM-based HPC integration
    - Nanopore (MinION) sequencing and real-time basecalling
  statistical_analysis:
    - R (tidyverse, lme4) and Python (pandas, scikit-bio)
    - Experimental designs: full factorial, fractional, and incomplete block designs
  genomic_analysis:
    - Reference genome alignment (BWA, Bowtie2)
    - Metagenomic profiling without de novo assembly
    - Learning advanced taxonomic profiling techniques

**Conferences_presentations:**
  - year: 2024
    event: American Society for Horticultural Science (ASHS)
    format: Oral Presentation
    title: "Optimizing Fungicide Programs for Corn Tar Spot"
